Gum is a general purpose UI layout tool built on object-oriented principles. Specifically it supports:

* Inheritance
* Object instances
* Default/overriding variables
* States (categorized and uncategorized)

Gum exports to human-readable XML, and can be extended either using MEF or by modifying the source code directly.
